# amazon-websscraper
I was inspired to start this project by reading the article about scraping Amazon for product data here: https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2021/10/building-amazon-product-scraper-nodejs/

If I find the example code in a blog post or article particularly interesting I try to take what I learned and implement it in a different manner.  In this case, I'm learning about Deno and TS in addition to learning about web scraping.
